# Microservice for storing and updating information for dogs (part of the course "Development Tools" in Master' Degree "Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems" by HSE)
Author: Nikita Protsanov (tg - @PerfectZero)

Link to the deployed service - https://dogs-clinic-data.onrender.com/.

As for now, the service is fully operating via the link, and the permanent cron task is created.
However, in case of inactivity, I hereby ask you to wait a few minutes cause the delay in deployment on the free Render plan could take some time. 
Thanks in advance.
